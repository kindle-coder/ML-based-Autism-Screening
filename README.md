Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) refers to a neurological developmental disorder characterised by an impaired communication and
social interaction ability which may also affect a patientâ€™s learning behaviour. It usually starts at an early age and persists for a
lifetime. There are various subtypes of Autism Spectrum disorder such as Asperger syndrome and Pervasive developmental
disorders. There is a lack of data availability for prediction purposes, making it hard to perform accurate analyses to improve the
effectiveness, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive accuracy of the ASD screening process.

The dataset [1] used in this project was created by Prof. Fadi Thabtah and made freely available after being published in the article
"Autism Spectrum Disorder Screening: Machine Learning Adaptation and DSM-5 Fulfillment". The dataset comprises a total of 20
features to be used for further examination primarily in discovering substantial autistic traits and developing the classification of ASD
cases. Out of the 20 features, ten consist of behavioral characteristics (AQ-10-Adult) as well as ten people
characteristics that have shown to be effective in identifying the ASD cases from controls in behavior science.

Machine learning (ML) gives novel chances to human behavior research and clinical interpretation. In this work, we use machine
learning to predict whether an individual has ASD based on demographic, genetic and AQ-10 features. This implementation can be
used to enhance ASD screening methods, making it more accessible and easy for the general public.
